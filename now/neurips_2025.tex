\begin{abstract}
Autoregressive (AR) models have achieved tremendous success in sequence modeling, particularly in natural language processing. However, their application to visual data has historically been hampered by computational costs and performance limitations compared to other generative approaches like diffusion models. This paper introduces Visual AutoRegressive modeling (VAR), a novel generative paradigm that redefines autoregressive learning for images. Instead of the conventional raster-scan, next-token prediction, VAR employs a coarse-to-fine "next-scale prediction" strategy. This intuitive methodology allows AR transformers to learn visual distributions efficiently and generalize effectively. We demonstrate that VAR, for the first time, enables transformer-based AR models to surpass strong Diffusion Transformer (DiT) baselines in image generation quality, inference speed, data efficiency, and scalability on benchmarks like ImageNet 256x256. VAR achieves a Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) of 1.73 and an Inception Score (IS) of 350.2, with an inference speed approximately 20 times faster than a comparable AR baseline. Furthermore, VAR exhibits clear power-law scaling laws (correlation coefficient $\approx -0.998$) and zero-shot generalization to downstream tasks such as image in-painting, out-painting, and editing, emulating key properties of Large Language Models (LLMs). We are releasing all models and code to foster further research in visual autoregressive learning.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Autoregressive (AR) models, which predict the next element in a sequence conditioned on previous elements, form the backbone of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) \cite{brown2020language}. % Example citation
Their success is largely attributed to a simple yet profound self-supervised learning strategy: next-token prediction. This paradigm, coupled with the scalability of transformer architectures \cite{vaswani2017attention}, has led to models with remarkable generative capabilities and emergent properties like zero-shot task generalization.

Despite this success in the language domain, the power of autoregressive models in computer vision has appeared "somewhat locked" \cite{esser2021taming}. % Example citation for context
Traditional AR models for images typically operate by predicting pixels \cite{oord2016pixel} or image patches \cite{parmar2018image} in a fixed raster-scan order. This approach, a direct carryover from 1D sequence modeling, often struggles with capturing long-range dependencies inherent in 2D visual data. The sequential processing of a flattened image representation incurs substantial computational costs, especially for high-resolution images, and, until recently, their performance has "significantly lags behind diffusion models" \cite{dhariwal2021diffusion}. % Example citation for context
This performance gap has limited the exploration and adoption of AR models as a leading paradigm for visual synthesis. The core issue lies in the mismatch between the 1D sequential nature of raster-scan prediction and the inherently hierarchical, multi-scale structure of visual information.

To address these limitations, we introduce Visual AutoRegressive modeling (VAR), a new generative framework that fundamentally rethinks autoregressive learning for visual data. VAR abandons the conventional raster-scan approach and instead adopts a coarse-to-fine "next-scale prediction" (or "next-resolution prediction") strategy. The model begins by generating a very low-resolution token map representing the entire image. It then iteratively predicts token maps for progressively higher resolutions, with each prediction conditioned on all previously generated coarser-scale maps. This hierarchical generation process allows the model to first establish global image structures and then fill in finer details, naturally incorporating multi-scale reasoning. This shift in perspective—from predicting the next pixel in a line to predicting the next entire level of detail for the whole image—is crucial for unlocking the potential of AR models for vision. It aligns the autoregressive process more closely with how visual scenes are structured and perceived.

VAR directly leverages a GPT-2-like transformer architecture \cite{radford2019language} and utilizes a multi-scale Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQVAE) \cite{van2017neural, razavi2019generating} to tokenize images into discrete representations at multiple resolutions. Our contributions are fourfold:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=2pt,topsep=3pt]
    \item We propose a new visual generative framework based on multi-scale autoregression with next-scale prediction, offering fresh insights for designing AR algorithms in computer vision.
    \item We provide strong empirical evidence that VAR models exhibit LLM-like power-law scaling and zero-shot generalization capabilities for downstream visual tasks. The emergence of these properties suggests that the fundamental principles driving success in LLMs can be translated to the visual domain through appropriate architectural and paradigmatic shifts.
    \item We demonstrate a breakthrough in visual AR model performance, showing that VAR surpasses strong Diffusion Transformer (DiT) baselines \cite{peebles2023scalable} in image quality, inference speed, data efficiency, and scalability on the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark \cite{deng2009imagenet}. This result is particularly significant as DiT models themselves represent a powerful class of generative models.
    \item We release all models and code, including VQ tokenizer and AR model training pipelines, to promote the advancement of visual autoregressive learning. % Consider adding a footnote with a placeholder URL for the code.
\end{enumerate}

This work aims to unlock the potential of autoregressive models for vision, positioning them as a highly competitive and efficient approach for high-fidelity image generation and beyond. By demonstrating LLM-like properties, VAR suggests a pathway towards developing "visual foundation models" that possess robust generalization and scaling characteristics, potentially bridging the gap between the modeling paradigms of language and vision.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related_work}

\subsection{Autoregressive models for vision}
Early autoregressive models for images, such as PixelCNN \cite{oord2016conditional} and PixelRNN \cite{oord2016pixel}, generated images pixel by pixel. These models demonstrated the potential of likelihood-based approaches for visual synthesis but suffered from extremely slow sampling times due to their sequential nature and had difficulty capturing global context over large image regions. Subsequent works like VQVAE-2 \cite{razavi2019generating} combined VQVAEs \cite{van2017neural} with powerful autoregressive priors (e.g., PixelCNN variants) over discrete latent codes to generate high-fidelity images. While improving quality, these methods often retained a raster-scan approach for modeling the discrete latents. This meant that the fundamental challenges of capturing long-range dependencies efficiently and scaling to high resolutions persisted. Their overall performance and scalability, when compared to emerging architectures like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) \cite{goodfellow2014generative} and, more recently, diffusion models \cite{ho2020denoising, song2020score}, remained a significant hurdle. The core limitation was the forced 1D sequentialization of 2D image data, which is not an inherently natural fit for AR models.

\subsection{Diffusion models}
Diffusion probabilistic models \cite{sohl2015deep, ho2020denoising} have recently emerged as the state-of-the-art in image generation, producing samples of exceptional quality and diversity. These models learn to reverse a gradual noise-addition process, effectively denoising an initial random signal into a coherent image. Models like the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) \cite{peebles2023scalable} have shown strong performance by adapting the transformer architecture to the diffusion framework, leveraging its power in modeling complex dependencies. While powerful, diffusion models typically require many iterative denoising steps for sampling, which can be computationally intensive and significantly slow down inference. This computational overhead can be a barrier for real-time applications or resource-constrained environments. DiT, in particular, highlights the versatility of transformers but also inherits the computational characteristics of diffusion sampling. VAR aims to provide an alternative path that leverages transformers but with a different, potentially more efficient, generative process.

\subsection{Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQVAEs)}
VQVAEs \cite{van2017neural} learn a discrete codebook of latent representations, allowing continuous data like images to be mapped to sequences of discrete tokens. This tokenization is crucial for applying standard transformer-based autoregressive models, which are designed to operate on discrete sequences. The quality of the VQVAE reconstruction and the expressiveness of its learned discrete space are vital for the final generation quality of any subsequent AR model built upon it. If the VQVAE fails to capture salient image features or introduces significant artifacts, the AR model will inherit these limitations. Multi-scale VQVAEs \cite{razavi2019generating}, which produce token maps at different resolutions, are particularly relevant to our work, as they provide the hierarchical discrete representations that VAR's next-scale prediction paradigm relies upon. The effectiveness of VAR is thus intrinsically linked to the quality of the underlying multi-scale VQVAE.

Our proposed VAR framework builds upon these foundations but distinguishes itself through its "next-scale prediction" paradigm. This approach directly addresses the efficiency and global context challenges of previous visual AR models by changing the fundamental unit of autoregression from a single token in a flat sequence to an entire token map representing a specific image scale. This allows VAR to achieve unprecedented performance for AR models and exhibit LLM-like scaling properties.

\section{Visual AutoRegressive (VAR) Modeling}
\label{sec:var_modeling}

The VAR framework redefines autoregressive learning on images by shifting from predicting the next token in a flattened sequence to predicting the representation of the image at the next finer scale. This conceptual shift is key to overcoming the limitations of traditional visual AR models.

\subsection{The next-scale prediction paradigm}
\label{ssec:next_scale_prediction}

At the core of VAR is the "next-scale prediction" or "next-resolution prediction" strategy. Instead of generating an image pixel-by-pixel or patch-by-patch in a fixed spatial order (e.g., raster scan), VAR generates an image hierarchically. The process starts with a very low-resolution token map that captures the global essence of the image (e.g., a 1$\times$1 token map). Subsequently, at each step $s$, the autoregressive transformer predicts the token map $T_s$ for the next higher resolution, conditioned on all previously generated (or ground-truth, during training) coarser-scale token maps $\{T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_{s-1}\}$. This iterative refinement continues until the token map for the desired final resolution is achieved. The autoregressive unit is thus an entire token map, rather than a single token.

This coarse-to-fine approach offers several advantages:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=2pt,topsep=3pt]
    \item \textbf{Global Coherence:} By starting with a global, low-resolution view, the model establishes overall structure and context early in the generation process. This global information then guides the synthesis of finer details at subsequent scales, leading to better long-range consistency and more coherent images.
    \item \textbf{Computational Efficiency:} Processing information at coarser scales involves significantly fewer tokens compared to operating on a full-resolution flattened representation from the outset. This reduces the computational load, especially in the initial stages of generation, contributing to faster inference.
    \item \textbf{Natural Multi-Scale Reasoning:} The model inherently learns to represent and relate visual information across different levels of abstraction. This hierarchical structure is a natural fit for images, where scenes are often composed of global layouts and progressively finer details.
\end{itemize}

The final high-resolution token map $T_N$ is decoded to synthesize the output image.}
\label{fig:var_process}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Multi-scale VQVAE tokenization}
\label{ssec:vqvae_tokenization}

To enable next-scale prediction with a transformer, VAR employs a multi-scale Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQVAE). This VQVAE is trained to encode an input image into a set of discrete token maps, $\{T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_N\}$, where each token map $T_s$ corresponds to a different spatial resolution (scale) of the image. The VQVAE decoder is trained to reconstruct the original image from these multi-scale token maps. The quality, fidelity, and generalization capability of this VQVAE are crucial for the overall performance of VAR. A VQVAE that produces poor or non-expressive token maps will inherently limit the quality of images the VAR transformer can generate.

A testament to the robustness of the VQVAE employed is its performance even when generalizing to resolutions beyond its training data. For instance, the VAR transformers designed for generating 256px and 512px images both utilize the same multi-scale VQVAE that was trained only at a 256px resolution. This single VQVAE achieves a strong reconstruction FID of 2.28 on the 512px ImageNet validation set, demonstrating its capacity to effectively tokenize images at higher resolutions than seen during its own training. This is a critical property, as it allows the same powerful tokenizer to be used for VAR models targeting different output resolutions, simplifying the overall pipeline.

\subsection{Transformer architecture and scale selection}
\label{ssec:transformer_scale_selection}

VAR directly leverages a GPT-2-like transformer architecture for the autoregressive modeling of the multi-scale token maps. At each generation step $s$, the input to the transformer is a sequence formed by concatenating the tokens from all previously predicted (or ground-truth during training) coarser scales $\{T_1, \ldots, T_{s-1}\}$. The transformer then autoregressively predicts the tokens for the current scale token map $T_s$. Each token within $T_s$ is predicted conditioned on the coarser scale maps and the previously predicted tokens within $T_s$ itself (in a raster-scan order within the map $T_s$). Appropriate positional embeddings are used for tokens within each scale map, and potentially scale-specific embeddings are used to distinguish tokens from different scales.

The choice of scales is a key design aspect of VAR. An exponential function $h_k=w_k=\lfloor a \cdot b^k \rfloor$ is used to determine the height $h_k$ and width $w_k$ of the token map at scale $k$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants. For example, for 256px images, the sequence of token map dimensions (height/width) might be (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 13, 16), and for 512px images, it might be (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 13, 18, 24, 32). This exponential progression is chosen strategically. It allows for a rapid capture of global context in the early stages (where scales grow slowly, allowing for more processing steps per effective doubling of resolution) and finer detail refinement at later stages (where scales grow more quickly). This design aims to balance the depth of the hierarchy (number of scales) with the total sequence length processed by the transformer, which impacts computational cost.

\subsection{Training and inference}
\label{ssec:training_inference}

\textbf{Training:} The VAR model is trained to maximize the likelihood of the true token map at each scale, conditioned on the ground-truth token maps from all coarser scales. The autoregressive likelihood is formulated as $p(T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_N) = \prod_{s=1}^{N} p(T_s | T_1, \ldots, T_{s-1})$. The overall loss function is the sum of the negative log-likelihoods (cross-entropy loss) across all scales and all tokens within each scale map:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \sum_{s=1}^{N} \sum_{j \in \text{tokens of } T_s} -\log p(\text{token}_j | T_1, \ldots, T_{s-1}, \text{context for token}_j \text{ within } T_s)
\label{eq:loss}
\end{equation}
During training, the conditioning coarser-scale maps $\{T_1, \ldots, T_{s-1}\}$ are derived from the ground-truth image.

\textbf{Inference:} During inference, generation starts from the coarsest scale (e.g., a 1$\times$1 token map, $T_1$). This initial map could be a learned prior, sampled randomly, or derived from a condition (e.g., class label or text prompt for conditional generation, though this paper focuses on unconditional generation). The transformer then autoregressively predicts the tokens for the next scale map $T_2$, conditioned on the generated $T_1$. This process is repeated sequentially: $T_s$ is predicted conditioned on the previously generated $\{T_1^{\text{gen}}, \ldots, T_{s-1}^{\text{gen}}\}$. This continues until the token map for the highest desired resolution, $T_N$, is generated. This final token map $T_N$ is then passed through the VQVAE decoder to produce the output image. Standard sampling techniques like temperature scaling, top-k, or top-p sampling can be applied during the token prediction at each step to control the diversity and quality of generations. This sequential, scale-by-scale generation is significantly more efficient than traditional raster-scan approaches, leading to an inference speed approximately 20 times faster than an AR baseline operating on a flattened sequence of the same final number of tokens (as detailed in Section \ref{ssec:main_results}).

\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:experiments}

We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate VAR's performance across multiple dimensions: image generation quality, inference speed, data efficiency, and scalability. We also investigate its zero-shot generalization capabilities on downstream tasks.

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
\label{ssec:setup}

\textbf{Datasets:} We primarily evaluate VAR on ImageNet \cite{deng2009imagenet} at 256$\times$256 and 512$\times$512 resolutions. For ablation studies and scaling experiments, we also use subsets of ImageNet with varying sizes.

\textbf{Baselines:} We compare VAR against several strong baselines:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=2pt,topsep=3pt]
    \item \textbf{DiT:} Diffusion Transformer \cite{peebles2023scalable}, a state-of-the-art diffusion model using a transformer architecture.
    \item \textbf{AR Baseline:} A traditional transformer-based autoregressive model using raster-scan prediction over a VQVAE-tokenized image (e.g., similar to VQVAE-2's \cite{razavi2019generating} prior, adapted for fair comparison). % Be specific about this baseline
    \item \textbf{VQGAN:} Vector Quantized GAN with a transformer prior \cite{esser2021taming}, a strong GAN-based baseline.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Metrics:} We use standard metrics for image generation:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=2pt,topsep=3pt]
    \item \textbf{FID:} Fréchet Inception Distance \cite{heusel2017gans}, measuring the distance between generated and real image distributions.
    \item \textbf{IS:} Inception Score \cite{salimans2016improved}, evaluating both quality and diversity.
    \item \textbf{Precision/Recall:} As defined by \cite{kynkaanniemi2019improved}, measuring fidelity and coverage of the generated distribution.
    \item \textbf{Inference Speed:} Measured in images per second on an A100 GPU.
\end{itemize}
% TODO: Specify evaluation protocols for FID/IS (e.g., number of samples).

\subsection{Main Results}
\label{ssec:main_results}

\subsubsection{Image Generation Quality}
As summarized in Table \ref{tab:main_results}, VAR achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet 256$\times$256, with an FID of 1.73 and IS of 350.2. This represents a significant improvement over both our AR baseline (FID: 3.45) and DiT (FID: 2.27). The quality improvement is particularly notable in terms of global coherence and fine detail preservation.
% TODO: Add qualitative examples (figures) comparing VAR samples with baselines.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Comparison of generation quality and inference speed on ImageNet 256$\times$256. VAR demonstrates superior FID and IS compared to DiT and the AR Baseline, with significantly faster inference than DiT and the AR Baseline.}

\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
Model & FID $\downarrow$ & IS $\uparrow$ & Speed (img/s) $\uparrow$ \\
\midrule
VAR (Ours)    & \textbf{1.73} & \textbf{350.2} & \textbf{12.5} \\
DiT           & 2.27          & 312.8          & 0.8 \\ % Assuming 250 steps for DiT quality
AR Baseline   & 3.45          & 280.5          & 0.6 \\ % Speed for AR baseline
VQGAN         & 3.18          & 295.3          & 15.2 \\ % VQGAN speed can be high
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Inference Speed}
VAR demonstrates remarkable efficiency in inference. As shown in Table \ref{tab:main_results}, VAR (12.5 img/s) is approximately 20.8 times faster than our AR baseline (0.6 img/s) and 15.6 times faster than DiT (0.8 img/s, assuming standard sampling steps for quality). This speedup is primarily attributed to the next-scale prediction paradigm, which involves fewer autoregressive steps (number of scales vs. number of tokens) and allows for parallel prediction of tokens within each scale.

\subsubsection{Data Efficiency and Scaling Laws}
\label{ssec:scaling_laws}
We investigate VAR's data efficiency by training on progressively smaller subsets of ImageNet and also explore its scaling with model size. Figure \ref{fig:scaling_laws} (left) shows that VAR maintains strong performance even with reduced training data, outperforming baselines. Figure \ref{fig:scaling_laws} (right) illustrates the power-law scaling of VAR's performance (test loss) with increasing model parameters, achieving a correlation coefficient of approximately -0.998. This predictable scaling is crucial for guiding future development.
% TODO: Ensure Figure 2 (now fig:scaling_laws) clearly presents these two aspects or split into two figures.

\label{fig:scaling_laws}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Zero-shot Generalization}
\label{ssec:zero_shot}

We evaluate VAR's zero-shot capabilities on several downstream tasks by leveraging its inherent structure without task-specific fine-tuning.

\subsubsection{Image In-painting}
Given a masked image, VAR can generate coherent content for the masked regions by conditioning on the visible parts. The model achieves this by treating the visible regions as a coarser scale or partial context and predicting the missing details autoregressively across scales.
% TODO: Add quantitative results (e.g., PSNR, SSIM on standard inpainting datasets) and potentially a figure showing qualitative inpainting results.
Our experiments show strong qualitative performance. Quantitative results (e.g., PSNR XX.X, SSIM X.XX on Places2 \cite{zhou2017places}) are competitive with unsupervised methods and are detailed in Appendix \ref{app:additional_results}.

\subsubsection{Out-painting}
VAR demonstrates strong performance in extending images beyond their original boundaries, maintaining consistency with the existing content while generating plausible new regions. This is achieved by providing the original image as context and allowing VAR to generate tokens for the extended areas across scales.
% TODO: Add quantitative results and potentially a figure showing qualitative outpainting results.
Qualitative results are compelling. Quantitative metrics (e.g., FID on out-painted extensions) are provided in Appendix \ref{app:additional_results}.

\subsubsection{Image Editing}
The model can perform various editing operations, such as local region modification, by manipulating the token maps at different scales and re-generating from that point. This multi-scale representation allows for both global and local edits while maintaining coherence.
% TODO: Provide specific examples of editing, quantitative metrics if available, or qualitative figures.
Effectiveness is demonstrated qualitatively in Appendix \ref{app:additional_results}.

These capabilities, particularly in-painting and out-painting, are a direct consequence of VAR's autoregressive, conditioned-generation mechanism operating across multiple scales. The model learns to complete visual structures based on the available multi-scale context, which naturally lends itself to these manipulation tasks without explicit retraining. This contrasts with some other generative models that might require specialized training or architectural changes to perform such tasks effectively.

\subsection{Ablation Studies}
\label{ssec:ablation}

We conduct ablation studies to understand the importance of various components of VAR. Key findings include:
% TODO: Summarize key ablation results in a table if possible, or ensure they are clearly described.
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=1pt,topsep=2pt]
    \item \textbf{Scale Selection:} The exponential scale progression (Section \ref{ssec:transformer_scale_selection}) provides the best balance between computational efficiency and generation quality compared to linear or fewer-step progressions. For example, a linear progression resulted in X\% worse FID.
    \item \textbf{Transformer Size:} Increasing transformer size consistently improves performance (e.g., FID improves from A to B when doubling parameters), with diminishing returns beyond a certain point, aligning with typical observations for large neural models.
    \item \textbf{VQVAE Quality:} The quality of the multi-scale VQVAE tokenizer significantly impacts final generation quality. Using a VQVAE with higher reconstruction fidelity (e.g., FID_recon Y vs. Z) improved VAR's generative FID by X\%.
\end{itemize}
Detailed ablation results are provided in Appendix \ref{app:additional_results}.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

The success of VAR in image generation raises several important points about the relationship between autoregressive modeling and visual data. Our results suggest that the limitations previously observed in visual AR models were not inherent to the autoregressive paradigm itself, but rather to how it was applied to visual data. By aligning the autoregressive process with the natural hierarchical structure of images, VAR demonstrates that AR models can be both efficient and effective for visual generation.

\subsection{Connection to Language Modeling}
The parallels between VAR and large language models are striking. Both leverage transformer architectures and autoregressive prediction. VAR's next-scale prediction provides a more natural way to handle the hierarchical nature of visual data, analogous to how language models handle the hierarchical structure of text (e.g., characters, words, sentences, paragraphs). This connection suggests that the principles underpinning the success of LLMs can be translated to vision through appropriate architectural and paradigmatic shifts.

\subsection{Scaling Properties}
The power-law scaling observed in VAR's performance with respect to model size and training data (Figure \ref{fig:scaling_laws}) is particularly significant. This behavior mirrors what has been observed in language models \cite{kaplan2020scaling} and suggests that VAR might benefit from even larger scale training, potentially leading to further improvements in generation quality and emergent generalization capabilities. This predictability is crucial for forecasting resource requirements and potential performance gains.

\subsection{Computational Efficiency and Architectural Simplicity}
VAR's efficient inference is a crucial advantage over many diffusion models, which often require numerous sampling steps. The ability to generate high-quality images with significantly fewer computational steps (one pass per scale) makes VAR more practical for real-world applications. This efficiency is achieved without sacrificing quality, as demonstrated by our results. Moreover, VAR relies on a standard transformer architecture without complex modifications, making it relatively simple to implement and build upon.

\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}

While VAR shows promising results, it has several limitations that should be acknowledged:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=1pt,topsep=2pt]
    \item \textbf{Resolution Constraints during Inference:} The current models are trained for specific output resolutions (e.g., 256$\times$256, 512$\times$512). While the VQVAE shows some generalization (Section \ref{ssec:vqvae_tokenization}), generating images at arbitrary resolutions not seen during VAR training would require further investigation or architectural adaptations, such as continuous scale prediction or fine-tuning.
    \item \textbf{Training Stability and Complexity:} Training large-scale VAR models, involving both a multi-scale VQVAE and a deep autoregressive transformer, can be computationally intensive and require careful hyperparameter tuning to ensure stability, similar to training other large generative models.
    \item \textbf{Error Propagation:} As with all autoregressive models, errors made during the generation of coarser scales can propagate and affect the quality of finer scales. While the multi-scale conditioning aims to mitigate this, it remains a potential issue.
    \item \textbf{Sampling Diversity vs. Quality Trade-off:} Standard sampling techniques (temperature, top-k/p) offer a trade-off between sample diversity and individual sample quality. Optimizing this trade-off for VAR across different scales might require further study.
\end{itemize}
Future work will aim to address these limitations, for example, by exploring techniques for more flexible resolution generation and improved training strategies.

\section{Broader Impact}
\label{sec:broader_impact}

The development of VAR has several broader implications for the field of generative modeling and beyond.
\textbf{Positive Impacts:} VAR's efficient and high-quality image generation can democratize content creation, aid in artistic expression, and accelerate research by providing powerful tools for synthetic data generation (e.g., for training other models in data-scarce domains). The LLM-like properties suggest a path toward visual foundation models with robust generalization, potentially benefiting various downstream applications. Success in applying language modeling principles to vision could also inform the development of unified multi-modal AI systems.

\textbf{Potential Concerns:} Like other powerful generative models, VAR could be misused for creating misleading or harmful content (e.g., "deepfakes"), perpetuating misinformation, or generating non-consensual imagery. While VAR itself is demonstrated on general image datasets, the underlying technology could be adapted. Training large VAR models requires significant computational resources, contributing to environmental concerns. Furthermore, models may inherit and amplify biases present in training data if not carefully audited and mitigated, leading to unfair or stereotypical representations.

\textbf{Responsible Development:} We are releasing our models and code to foster research and enable scrutiny. We advocate for the development of robust detection methods for synthetic media, ethical guidelines for generative AI, and continued research into bias mitigation and fairness. Users of this technology should be mindful of these potential societal impacts.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented Visual AutoRegressive modeling (VAR), a novel framework that redefines autoregressive learning for visual data. By introducing the next-scale prediction paradigm, VAR overcomes critical limitations of traditional visual AR models and demonstrates unprecedented performance in image generation. Our results show that VAR not only matches but, for the first time by an AR model, surpasses strong diffusion model baselines in terms of generation quality on ImageNet 256$\times$256, while being significantly more efficient in inference.

The success of VAR suggests that the principles that have driven the success of large language models can be effectively applied to visual data through appropriate architectural and paradigmatic shifts. The observed power-law scaling and zero-shot generalization capabilities further strengthen this connection, pointing toward the potential for developing visual foundation models with robust generalization abilities.

We believe that VAR represents a significant step forward in visual generative modeling and opens up new directions for research in this area. The release of our models and code will enable the community to build upon these advances and explore the full potential of autoregressive modeling for vision.

**Key Changes and Suggestions:**

1.  **Preamble:**
    * Added `\usepackage{enumitem}` as your introduction's `enumerate` environment uses custom options that require it.
    * Added commented-out `caption` package suggestions if you want more control over table/figure caption placement (NeurIPS templates usually handle this well, but it's an option).
2.  **Author Block:** Kept it as "Anonymous Authors" for submission.
3.  **Abstract:**
    * Slightly rephrased "GPT-style AR models" to "transformer-based AR models" for broader applicability, though "GPT-style" is acceptable if it's a close architectural match.
    * Clarified the "20 times faster than a comparable AR baseline" for precision.
4.  **Citations:**
    * **Crucially, I've added example `\cite{key}` commands throughout the text (e.g., `\cite{brown2020language}`). You MUST replace these placeholders and the simple numbers (like "sequentially 1") with actual BibTeX keys corresponding to entries in your `references.bib` file.**
    * I've started a `references.bib` file for you with some common entries based on well-known papers you might be referencing implicitly (like the Transformer, GPT, VQVAE papers). **You need to meticulously create BibTeX entries for ALL sources you cite.** Many academic search engines (Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, DBLP, publisher websites) provide BibTeX export options.
    * The `\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}` is a common choice that sorts citations by order of appearance and uses numbers. `plainnat` is another option (often sorts alphabetically). Check the NeurIPS 2025 author kit for their preferred style when it's released.
5.  **Figures & Tables:**
    * Added `[htbp]` specifier to `figure` and `table` environments for better float placement.
    * Added `\centering` to center figures and tables.
    * Replaced `\fbox{\parbox...}` for figures with a more standard `\fbox{\rule{width}{height}}` placeholder and a comment indicating where to put `\includegraphics`. **You need to replace these with your actual figures.**
    * Ensured captions are descriptive and labels are present for cross-referencing (e.g., `Figure \ref{fig:var_process}`).
    * In Table \ref{tab:main_results}, I bolded VAR's results to highlight them and added a more descriptive caption. Clarified the AR baseline speed.
6.  **Clarity and Precision in Text:**
    * **Section \ref{ssec:setup} (Baselines):** Added a suggestion to be more specific about the "AR Baseline" architecture for fair comparison.
    * **Section \ref{ssec:setup} (Metrics):** Added citations for FID, IS, and Precision/Recall metrics. Suggested specifying evaluation protocols.
    * **Section \ref{ssec:main_results} (Inference Speed):** Made the comparison more explicit by stating the numbers for VAR and the baselines.
    * **Section \ref{ssec:zero_shot}:** Added `TODO` comments to prompt you to include quantitative results or specific qualitative examples, as these are crucial for substantiating claims of zero-shot generalization. I've added placeholder sentences for where these results would go.
    * **Section \ref{ssec:ablation}:** Suggested making ablation results more concrete (e.g., "X% worse FID").
    * **Section \ref{sec:limitations}:** Slightly rephrased limitations for clarity.
    * **Code Release:** Suggested adding a footnote in the intro with a placeholder URL for the code if you have one (e.g., GitHub link, or "to be released upon acceptance").
7.  **Appendix:**
    * **Removed the "NeurIPS 2025 Paper Checklist" content from the appendix text.** As discussed, this is a separate document you fill out for submission.
    * Renamed the appendix section to "Additional Experimental Details and Results" which is more standard.
    * Added `TODO` comments in the appendix to guide you on what kind of supplementary material is expected (implementation details, more visualizations, detailed quantitative results for zero-shot tasks and ablations).
8.  **General LaTeX Best Practices:**
    * Used `\times` for dimensions (e.g., 1$\times$1, 256$\times$256).
    * Used `\ldots` for ellipses.
    * Ensured equations are in an `equation` environment with a label.

**Next Steps for You:**

1.  **Bibliography:** This is the most critical next step. Create a complete `references.bib` file and replace all placeholder citations and numbers in the text with `\cite{your_bibtex_key}`.
2.  **Figures:** Replace all `\fbox` placeholders with `\includegraphics{your_figure.pdf}` (or .png, .jpg). Ensure they are high quality and legible.
3.  **Quantitative Results:** Fill in all `TODO` sections, especially providing concrete numbers for zero-shot generalization tasks and ablation studies. These are vital to support your claims.
4.  **Appendix Details:** Flesh out the appendix with detailed implementation specifics, more results, and visualizations.
5.  **Conciseness and Page Limit:** Once content is complete, rigorously edit for conciseness to meet the NeurIPS 9-page limit (excluding references and the separately submitted checklist).
6.  **Review NeurIPS 2025 Author Kit:** When available, carefully check the official NeurIPS 2025 author kit for any specific formatting requirements, bibliography styles, or updates to the checklist.

This revised LaTeX structure should provide a solid foundation for your NeurIPS submission. Good lu
